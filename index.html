        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8 text-xl">Naʽat (Bengali: নাত; Punjabi and Urdu: نعت) is poetry in praise
          of the
          Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The practice is popular in South Asia (Bangladesh, Pakistan and India),
          commonly in Bengali, Punjabi or Urdu. People who recite Naʽat are known as Naʽat Khawan</p>

        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium ">History</h1>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8 text-xl">It is difficult to trace the history of Naʽat khawani since no
          authenticated record of when it was initiated can be found. One early author, Hassan, was known as
          Shair-e Darbaar-e Risalat. Even before accepting Islam he was a poet, but after embracing Islam he
          gave a new turn to his poetry and started writing Na'ats in honor of Muhammad.[4] He was famous for
          his poetry that defended Muhammad in response to rival poets who attacked him and his religion.
          Therefore, Hassan is known as the first sana-khawaan (naʽat reciter) of that time. After that many a
          poet followed this trend and totally dedicated themselves towards writing of naʽats.

          Talaʽ al Badru ʽAlayna, is a traditional Islamic poem known as nasheed recited to Muhammad during
          his completion of migration to Medina in 622 CE,[5] is believed to be one of the earliest naʽats.
